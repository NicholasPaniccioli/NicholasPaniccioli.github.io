## Welcome! üñê
### To My Portfolio's README

This is my [portfolio site's](https://nicholaspaniccioli.github.io/) github repo. In it you'll find:
- The HTML files
- The CSS file
- JavaScript in the src folder
- And Images

In this project I created my own portfolio site. In it you'll see all the things
I've worked on. From programs, websites, art, etc. It's still new and I haven't
quite put up everything, but don't worry we are getting there!

On my portfolio you can find documentation for projects, a blog where I write about
my process/plan and what's new, and a link for my [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/OS7vwvyW/portfolio-website) 
to see what I have planned next.
