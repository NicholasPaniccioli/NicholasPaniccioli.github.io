            <p class="update">
                It has been sometime since my last update, but I have good reason for that. For the past few months I've been hard at work for my very first internship!
                It has been an amazing experience, and as it has started to wind down I've found some free time on my hand to work on old projects and prepare for the future.
                One of the first things I've worked on is cleaning up and improving on my current portfolio site. New color scheme, cleaned up the CSS and HTML, and did some
                touchups on the home page. With the new skills and techniques I've learned it has me excited for revamping my site and making the overall look feel more professional.
                <br><br>While this is the first post after a long abscense there's not much more to say. The only plans I have for now are to work on the website and continue some
                personal writing projects.
            </p>

            <br><br>

            <h4 class="updateHead">October 12th, 2021</h4>
            <p class="update">
                To explain why my github has been a little barren since my last post I have to share some great news, I got an internship/co-op.
                From emailing the company back and forth, contacting my advisor and filling out a form, and also moving rooms and changing my setup,
                it has left little time for me to work on my portfolio site. Now with this new internship on the horizon my current plans have changed
                a bit. Before I was improving my skills with various languages and working on projects in order to build up my resume to get an internship.
                But now that goal is about to be reached, so what comes next? 
                <br><br>For starters I want to say how proud and fun it has been to work on the guessing game and that it has given me a great 
                confidence boost in myself and my skills. I've finished the main game and even got to work and finish some long term goals like the 
                stats tab and achievements. The game for all intents and purposes is complete. Work on the game will slow down, but not stop 100%. 
                There's still plenty left for me to do with art, store items, CSS updates, and quite possibly more mechanics. Only these changes will take a 
                little longer to accomplish as my focuses shift.
                <br><br>So my next steps involve doing more in-depth practice and research on the programs and languages that my next internship uses. 
                This way when I start, I do the best possible job I can. I've turned this plan to start work on another project among the other things 
                I have to teach or refresh myself on. This project will be created in Unity, programmed with C#, and be a 2D game. I don't want to spoil all
                the fun so that's where I'll leave it.
                <br><br>Last thing I want to address is my blog posts. They come out inconsistently as I don't know what warrants a post but I also don't not
                want to post as to avoid it looking like I've just abandoned my portfolio site. So starting today I will be posting at the end of each month, 
                12 posts a year. Just so I can discuss the important stuff leaving out filler.
                <br><br>This is probably the longest post to date, but a lot of important stuff has happened and I'm thrilled to start work on new projects.
            </p>

                After a couple of weeks and some days being laser focused on my code, the Guessing Game has been complete! At least functionailty
                wise. The game works, the store has buyable items, stats keeps track of player's numbers, and achievements are being rewarded 
                on set criteria. It's really exciting to see this project come to life months after it initially started. Now the plan continues
                on to cleaning up the look of the game and adding more content.
                <br><br>Besides that, I am currently working on a new game. It's in the early stages of development, so mostly writing the story
                and some concept art. The end goal with this is to get back into full-on game development using Unity and getting more
                practice with C#.
                <br><br>Since last update I've talked about a work schedule and sticking to it and after a bit of trial and error I finally found 
                something that worked out. And as a result I managed to finish the guessing game and start a new project. As fall starts to begin
                I'm eager to see how far I will make it with both of these games by the end of the year and see how they will be helping me with 
                my future endeavors.

            <p class="update">
                Wow it has already been a month since my last update. Woops! Time has flown and I've been a bit busy. Traveling and on a family
                vacation. As of late though I've been applying to a couple of internships/co-ops and today updating my Guessing Game. I finally
                finished the store logic which is really exciting, so now I just need to add more content then I can work on the other tabs.
                But while I'm doing all this I've also been planning and building a schedule for the next few weeks to help keep me organized 
                and focused. I'm currently trying to juggle job searching, my guessing game, a new game I want to develop, and learning and
                refreshing my C# and Unity skills.
                <br><br>All that said hopefully I'll be able to keep up with this schedule given I've tried a work schedule before. If I can stick
                to it though my portfolio will be decently done within the year and my game will be in the start of development. My focus has greatly
                shifted to reach these goals and now more than ever I'm going to do whatever it takes to accomplish them. I can't wait to show you
                guys and I can't wait to prove to myself I can do this.

            <h4 class="updateHead">August 11th, 2021</h4>
            <p class="update">
                As the final month of summer starts, it's time to reflect on the goals that I had given to myself towards
                the beginning. I have accomplished making a game of sorts with my Number Guessing Game but am still working
                on a few more mechanics and the store. I have also been updating my portfolio and the CSS along with it. Other than 
                that I have come short on updating my other past products and even adding the other hadnful of projects I had worked
                on throughout my college career.
                <br><br>With that said I would say this summer has allowed me to get a better look into myself and what works and what doesn't.
                I had planned to try and wake up early and commit to a 9-5 work ethic. That worked for about a week but my college habits
                adn general inability to fall asleep made that very difficult. I find that most work gets done in middle of night when everyone
                is fast asleep. I also discovered that I hyper fixate on things making it very difficult for me to multiask. If you were to look
                at my github repo for this project you'd see there's been a big gap between updates. I've been so focused on side jobs and other 
                hobbies that I pay no mind to what I love doing, coding.
                <br><br>So what brings me back? Well motivation once again to start applying for jobs/internships. I don't just want to 
                hyperfixate and only focus on a summer job, I want to fixate and focus on the stuff that I love,
                the thing I went to school for, which is programming. My goal now is to get that first step towards achieving the career I want 
                and be able to really focus on that. I just need to find the right company that'll see how much I want this and see that I'm
                willing to learn and grow and be a valuable asset to their dev teams. So until then, its going to be slow and meticulous work, day in
                and day out of applying to jobs. If you're reading this and thinking of hiring me but are unsure, read this. I'm ready and if
                given the chance I'll work hard everyday to show that I am.

                I'm back! And wow...that break was longer than expected, but very needed. Being able to take a break
                and coming back has me excited to get back into coding. One thing I was able to accomplish on my small
                vacation was the planning and writing out of projects. Which is what brings me back for this update.
                <br><br>Over the course of this passing summer I'm going to try to 'simulate' a regular work week. A good ol'
                9-5. I have written out plans for my resume, old projects, and new ones that I will be working on during
                this time each day. This will also give myself time to work on myself in regards to sharpening and improving
                on my coding skills. The plan I have set out for myself is an exciting test to see how focused I
                can be and how far I can improve. There will definitely be days where I need a break and won't do much
                but as long as I find a rhythm and stick with it I'll have a a decent looking resume with some impressive
                projects by the end of the summer.
                <br><br>Now this new blog entry doesn't come without resume updates. The project documentation page now 
                has a better layout that fits with my portfolio site and Landmark Finder now has documentation! On top of 
                that I was having issue with my html pages being to short (due to lack of content) and as a result the 
                footer would float up leaving white space at the bottom. I've tried absolute and sticky positions to make 
                it stay at the bottom, but never got the desired result. Taking some code and giving credit in 
                <a href="sources.html"><strong>sources</strong></a> I found a fix and so no longer will the footer have 
                left over white space.
                <br><br>That concludes this long winded entry. I can't wait to show you all what I have in store!

            <p class="update">
                As of 1:43 AM (when I'm writing this) it looks that I have officially "finished" my 
                portfolio website. If you've been reading my past logs, you know I've been slowly working 
                to a more official/clean looking design. I can confidently say that I'm proud with the look 
                and feel of my portfolio.
                <br><br>So I'm not saying I'm done with portfolio. I still have much to add and then adjust
                as I go along. Individual project pages with documentation, meaning a new button, meaning more
                CSS changes. And of course more projects! But now I can say that even if I add more projects,
                implementing them into the portfolio will be easy due in fact to the slideshow feature. But I
                can always improve. Maybe a page to show all my projects at once to avoid constant clicking or
                a way to organize these messy blogs from oldest to newest or vice versa.
                <br><br>As of now though I'm happy with how this portfolio looks and with only two projects
                on display I need to add a lot more before I make a project page. For the next week or two
                I'm going to take a break. I just finished classes and am officially done at RIT (besides my 
                needed co-ops). So I think I deserve a break. Well, not a complete break. I'm going to take 
                this time to plan out projects that I have in mind, as well as relax. I have so many ideas on
                hand that I know if I just dive right in that nothing will come of it due to the constant jumping
                back and forth. I'm very excited to see what kind of plan I have at the end of this, but even
                if it's something barebones it'll be a start. And I can't wait to show you all what I have planned!

                It has been quite a while since my last update. For good reason. I took focus
                towards my academics hoping to finish strong this semester and have achieved just that.
                I write this during the last week of school and have finally finished everything. Now I
                will be shifting my focus on getting a co-op. So for this upcoming summer I have many 
                plans to get myself in a better position when I start to apply.
                <br><br>
                The plans are such:<br>
                - Update and polish my Portfolio<br>
                - Work on new side projects<br>
                - Revamp and update old projects
                <br><br>
                As of this new update I'm currently working on restructuring the layout and look of my
                homepage. With this new update a different presentation of my projiects. Before it was 
                a grouped up showing of each project, but now it's more like a slideshow. In my opinion
                it makes the presentation stand out more and not look so clunky. I just need to make it
                look appealing, but that will be done slowly after this update is out. Hopefully by 
                the time anyone reads it, this will be done.

                For the latest update I added some flair to the buttons; hovering colors, open a 
                new tab for projects, and responsiveness on smaller window screens. I am aware 
                though that the buttons do overlap on smaller phone screens and I plan to 
                update that at a later time.
                <br><br>I've also made some smaller updates with responsiveness and color 
                scheme. I can now say that I'm happy with the condition and look of my 
                portfolio. I'm in a position where any future projects or sections can be added
                comfortably and without much problems to provide easy responsiveness. Now I can
                switch my focus to updating old projects as well as include other things like 
                documentation pages for each of them.
                <br><br>It goes without saying that this portfolio is nowhere perfect and there
                is plenty room for improvement, but I want to get back into coding projects other
                than html/css and I'm excited to show off what I can create.

                It has been awhle since the last update and for that I apologize. Do not
                fear my plans remain unchanged! At the moment I've been kepy busy with
                midterms, co-op searching, and personal stuff. Now that I found some free
                time to update my website I thought it was necessary for another update.
                <br><br>For this update, after some discussion and feedback with my advisor
                I've made some changes to the layout and added more stuff. Don't worry I'm

                As I'm writing this at approximately 1:13 AM one thing comes to mind,
                accomplishment. For the past two weeks or so I've been working on my
                portfolio website from scratch. While it would be as simple and easy
                to just find a template, post my resume on it and call it a day, I didn't
                want that. HTML and CSS are not my strong suits and I wanted to fix 
                that. Challenging myself is the goal for this portfolio and so far I 
                think I've done a great job. 
                <br><br>As of this moment, I've successfully created cards that link to
                past projects and worked on page responsiveness that changes the size
                and layout of necessary elements. While that may not sound impressing,
                taming the beast that is CSS, for me is an achievement.
                <br><br>What's the plan now? Now I'm going to keep working on the 
                portfolio. Clean up the CSS and make the overall appearance look more
                clean. I'm also going to work on my past projects and try to expand my
                skills with JavaScript.
