                    <p class="projDesc">
                        A few months after I finished my last class at RIT I found myself itching to create a game. 
                        With some new found experience in JS I wanted to make something small in scale, yet still fun. 
                        I also knew I wanted to mess with random number generation so the idea of a number guessing game 
                        just made sense.
                        <br><br>It started with creating a minimal viable product. Getting the basic mechanic to work and 
                        nothing else. Is the number random? Yes. Can the player Guess? Yes. Can they Win? Yes. And so on. Once
                        those were done it was about the checks and balances; giving limits on guesses, no words, adding
                        a higher or lower mechanic, etc. Testing and testing until the base game was complete! I had my
                        simple game done, but for me simple wasn't enough.
                        <br><br>After I had finished the game, I created a point system. Win the game, win a point. Then 
                        it turned to a store to buy different colored backgrounds. Then different points for less or more guesses.
                        Which then turned into an entire achievements tab, let's reward the player not only for winning,
                        but for also playing. For those that love to know it all, let's give them their statistics. And of course
                        with each new mechanic and tab added, more and more testing was needed. With the latest update 
                        putting this game in a place I'm 100% happy with.

                <!-- Landmark Finder Documentation -->
                <div class="projectsDocumentation" id="landmarkFinder">
                    <p class="projDesc">
                        This project was originally created as a school project back in April 2020.
                        For a month I had to program a site that used Two APIs together to create something useful.
                        So I designed my own API using PHP to organize and return Landmarks based on user input.
                        then combined with the MapBox API, I was able to map out and give back the location of those
                        landmarks.
                        <br><br>
                        While I was unable to finish the project, the final product would've included functionality
                        such as facts and pictures of the landmarks showing up, more ways to filter through landmarks,
                        and more ways to interact with the map.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall the project deals in HTML/CSS, JSON, PHP, and APIs.

                    <p class="projDesc">
                        Outer Space Experience was a school project I worked on in March of 2020.
                        The goal of the project was to create a visual experience using Canvas and the AudioContext API to
                        allow a user to change multiple settings of what was being shown. I gave users the options to change
                        the speed of the surrounding planets, the color, and direction of the visual audio.
                        <br><br>
                        The project is finished as of right now with no urgency for updates. My plans for the project however
                        do include some updates to the layout and the audio waves because they aren't perfectly perpendicular.
                        Other than that it's just going through and refreshing myself on AudioContext, Canvas, and seeing other
                        ways to improve on the project.
                        <br><br>
                        Summed up this project dealt with HTML/CSS, JSON, AudioContext API, and Canvas.

                        Welcome one and all to the marvelous Pixel Art Gallery! Here you will find a collection of some of the finest
                        work that I have contributed to the pixel art world. Everything from assets used in school projects to
                        art I created in my downtime. Each piece will have a small blurb to go along side it to help give context.
                        <br><br>Pixel art is something that I love to make in my free time. So being able to put it in games for school or 
                        as a favicon for my portfolio is a chance I jump at. While my technics are amateurish, it's something I enjoy
                        doing and continue to try to get better at. So take a look at what I've done and I hope you enjoy.

                        You may be wondering, why have an image of my portfolio site in my portfolio site? Well that's because
                        everything you see in this entire site was done by me! You heard right, I did everything from the HTML, 
                        CSS, and even the JS (with some exceptions). But why not just use a template from online?
                        <br><br> Well this project was fueled by my passion to learn more about something that I wasn't so good at, 
                        HTML and CSS. While I'm no professional now, I feel way more knowledgeable with them both and 
                        have the confidence that I can learn more to really enhance what I already laid out. On top of getting 
                        more comfortable with HTML and CSS, I found that those two languages wouldn't help me with a lot of the
                        more dynamic tasks that I wanted. So, I ended up learning and using more JavaScript throughout my site.
                        Not only did it help me achieve what I needed, but it pushed me to create a simple game that anyone could play
                        and thus 'Guess The Number' was created.
                        <br><br>Working on this site from scratch has been amazing. I was able to grow in confidence with my skills,
                        but it also helped me create one of my favorite projects/games to-date. And as of most recently I gave the 
                        entire site a whole new look! Meaning new colors, new pictures, more efficient HTML, CSS, and JS, and added
                        projects! That's exactly what I love about this entire project. It's the perfect extension of myself, as I grow
                        so does this site.

                <!-- Virtual Reality Convention Center -->
                <div class="projectsDocumentation" id="vrConvention">
                    <p class="projDesc">
                        During my first internship at VR Networking I was given plenty of work. However, it wasn't until I was given 
                        the task to design and layout a convention center that my game design skills would be utilized. The space was to be used
                        on AltSpace for both VR and PC, and every moment of it was amazingly beautiful and excruciating. There was a lot of planning, 
                        concept art, breaking, modeling, placing, turning, colliding, testing, VR-ing? The idea is there. The point being, I put a 
                        tremendous amount of work into the world I created and I couldn't be prouder.
                        <br><br>I was given a hollow shell, some assets, few directions, and a lot of personal freedom in Unity when it came to laying out.
                        Making some concept art and going back and forth with my supervisor we found something we liked and I got to work.
                        At first it was overwhelming, there's nothing here and I have to fill it with how much? But I chipped away at it, started
                        with one small section and built out. At first a botanical garden, then some rest areas next to it, the booths, more areas 
                        and seats, and before I knew it the entire space was filled. Even after putting on my headset and seeing the world, 
                        I could not believe my eyes.
                        <br><br>However it wasn't always easy, I was also responsible for optimizing the entire space. Going through the assets to minimize
                        the amount of triangles and adjusting the images/materials to lower the amount of space taken. Creating prefabs of booths and foliage, 
                        making them easy to edit for future use. In fact, the entire space was crafted so that once the internship is over my supervisor
                        can easily pick up the work where I left behind and easily edit every aspect.
