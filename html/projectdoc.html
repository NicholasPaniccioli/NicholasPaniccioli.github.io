                            two levels, Suburbia and The Sewers, as well as write the background and history for each.

                            but also practice more with JavaScript. I was tired of just developing my portfolio site and wanted to gain 
                            more experience with developing a game. So I brainstormed something simple and got straight to work.
                            It started in July 2021 and completion of a MVP occured around September 2021. 
                            With more updates and mechanics being added til around November the same year.

                            application with a real world usage. After some thought I decided to work on a map that would help locate
                            famous landmarks and give info of each one. To my surprise though I was unable to find any API that had info
                            on multiple landmarks. So I took it upon myself to craft my very own.

                            allow a user to change multiple settings of what was being shown. I gave users the options to change
                            the speed of the surrounding planets, the color, and direction of the visual audio.

                            <br><br>In the beginning of Februrary 2021, this site was personal project born out of necessity. I needed a way to show off 
                            my programming skills and like most other programmers a portfolio site is an absolute must. Although I had another problem, 
                            I was still lacking confidence in my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills. So I saw an opportunity to hit two stones with one bird
                            ....early worm gets the bird? Anyways I saw the chance to build my own site from the ground up. Everything you see on this site
                            was carefully crafted by me! It's the perfect extension of myself, as I grow so does the site, constantly evolving from different 
                            looks and new funtionality, so please excuse some messes here and there.

                            Welcome to the VR Convention Centre, here you can host a booth for your business or learn about a new industry. 
                            Explore this massive VR world I created where businesses can connect, people can meet others with similar interests, 
                            and presentations can be hosted to teach the public other new and fascinating topics from VR to Marketing.

                            <br><br>During my first Intership at VR Networking, I was tasked with creating a VR space. A space where people can meet,
                            show off their businesses, and shows can be held to spread info with those who share the same passions. The centre was to be
                            created in Unity and optimized from the way it can be edited to its performance on VR headsets. From November 2021 to the
                            end of December that year I had to design and complete this space along with additonal sections/variations.

                            - Sketched, designed, revised the layout of the entire VR space<br>
