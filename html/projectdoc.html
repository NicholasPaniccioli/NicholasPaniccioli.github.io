                        <p>The development of this project started <strong>July 9th 2021</strong>,
                        as a means of something fun for me to create while expanding my knowledge
                        on Javascript and CSS. I wanted to create something where I can use both
                        my gaming and web design skills.</p>
                        
                        <br><strong>July 11th 2021</strong><br>
                        <p>After a bit of time and effort the game is finally done. Almost done anyways,
                        from the V1.0 image we have a look, where the game is very bland in style
                        and not a lot of logic is finished yet. The game at this point checks if the
                        user has guesses left and if they answer correctly. But it does not check to
                        see if they should be able to guess after they guess correctly.
                        As for the process, the user presses start, and the JS then changes the start
                        button to a restart one and also adds more html elements like the guess button
                        and text box. The user guesses and the JS responds based on if they have enough
                        guesses and/or if the number matches the one randomly created. If it matches, they
                        win! (but doesnt stop them from guessing). If not the game continues and their
                        total guesses lower until they eventually hit 0 in which they can no longer
                        guess and must hit restart.
                        It is very exciting to see that something I created is functioning and I’m
                        already brainstorming on what other mechanics I may be able to add.
                        As of now I have point systems, and fully functioning logic in my plans. And confetti!</p>
                        
                        <br><strong>July 12th 2021</strong><br>
                        <p>It’s late and not even a minute has passed 12am and Im continuing work on this
                        project. And V1.1 is done (No new picture as only new text has been added so
                        nothing visual has changed) I added some more logic and conditions so now
                        even with a correct answer the player can no longer continue to guess. Now
                        on to working on the higher and lower system.
                        Okay it is 1:16am and the Higher or Lower function now works! When a user guesses
                        I have JS checking and comparing the numbers to give back appropriate feedback.
                        The game is finally complete and I am filled with immense joy seeing the minimal product done.
                        It’s 5:47pm and I have just pushed a final check for user guesses.
                        Now player’s won’t be able to guess when they use words.</p>
                        
                        <br><strong>July 14th</strong><br>
                        <p>As the game and its main mechanics have been finished I have finally implemented
                        a point system upon playing the game completing V1.2. Using local storage, points are saved and
                        then earned upon wins in the game, And because they are in local storage you can
                        leave the site and come back and still have your points! As of now though not much
                        can be done with them, but plans to integrate a shop with different backgrounds and
                        confetti is in the works.</p>
                        
                        <br><strong>August 11th 2021</strong><br>
                        <p>It has been awhile since I last touched my project, due in part to distractions,
                        side jobs, and other activities that have required my attention. But I have been
                        looking into ways of getting my goals to work for the Guessing Game like confetti
                        on wins and a store. While the store should be relatively easy to make, the confetti
                        has proven more difficult as I need to find a way to layer it over the screen and also
                        should I make my own? Should I use canvas? Pixel art? Or do I just find a royalty free GIF
                        online and use that? I’m exploring my options, so in the meantime I plan to work on the store
                        and have purchasable items that will change the background and button colors, and even maybe the style.</p>
                        
                        <br><strong>August 15th 2021</strong><br>
                        <p>After doing some research and figuring out how to do a proper overlay I have finally implemented
                        V1.3 which adds the long awaited confetti! Well not 100%. The logic is there and now it's easy to
                        put any picture or GIF in place of the current test GIF that I made. Now to make
                        better looking confetti and then create a store.</p>
                    
                        <br><strong>August 19th 2021</strong><br>
                        <p>Tabs have been added which is paving the way to having a store and other things for my game.
                        V1.4 and V1.41 have been pushed. They bring new tabs and css changes for the tabs and other
                        responsiveness towards smaller screens. Currently tabs are buttons set with the same JS I used
                        on the slideshow on my index page. Only instead of pictures and some buttons its going to be used
                        to switch between the game, the store, and eventually achievements and player stats.</p>
                    
                        <br><strong>September 1st, 9th, & 12th, 2021</strong><br>
                        <p>So we have a lot of ground to cover. Due in my part for forgetting to write updates.
                        So to make things easier we're going to break it down by the dates and what happened.
                        <br><br>Sept 1st - V1.4.3 I created and added my own pixel art confetti for the win screen. 
                        I'm extremely happy with it as Itss fun to see something I made come to life in the game and it's confetti!
                        <br><br>Sept 9th - V1.5 This was a big day. I sat myself down and worked entirely on the logic for the store. Previously
                        all the store checked for was if they had a certain amount of points and then unlocked the color(and you could switch it).
                        It didn't take away points and when the page refreshed the colors would be locked again.
                        So to keep this short I created a function that would check the color picked, how much it was,
                        and what to do if the player did or didn't have the right amount points. So now the store acts like a store.
                        I also added a function that uses a new localStorage key/value in order to keep unlocked items, unlocked. Even after refreshing the page.
                        <br><br>Sept 12th - V1.5.1 So after resting for the weekend from a good coding session I came back to work
                        only to find the store no longer working. Colors weren't staying unlocked when refreshed, my buttons attritbutes were no longer changing,
                        and worst of all unlocked colors still took points when you wanted to use them. So I had to redo
                        the way my buttons worked. I created a whole new section of buttons that are now responsible for
                        color changing and one row responsible for unlocking. So now when clicked the unlock button hides and
                        the color changing buttons appears. Lastly made a few adjustments to the function that keeps things unlocked and the store now works! Again</p>
                        
                        <br><strong>September 20th 2021</strong><br>
                        <p>V2.0 is complete and brings with it a newly completed tab! Stats has been a long term goal
                        that I'm excited to finally have completed. Now players who play the guessing game can find all the
                        fun little statistics about how they play, from the number of times they've won to how many points
                        they've earned over the course of their entire time playing. All of this was accomplished by working
                        with some JS and the local storage. Creating some logic for each stat and placing those functions
                        in the correct spot allow me to update and change the stats that I have created for the player.
                        Now while this doesn't changemuch in the way of game mechanics it's fun to see the numbers grow
                        and answer the question of 'how good am I?'.<br>
                        With the stats tab finished that leaves one big challenge left, Achievements. Currently the plan
                        is to write/put 10 or so individual achievements players can earn. Do some art assets so when
                        they do earn them they get fun pixel art badges. And when all of that is done, start to write out
                        the JS functions that will overwatch and reward players with these badges. That concludes the V2.0 update!</p>
                    
                        <br><strong>September 23rd 2021</strong><br>
                        <p>V2.5 is out and players can now start earning achievements! All the logic is placed and everything
                        seems to work without a hitch, but some longer playtesting will make that certain. With the game pretty much
                        finished, what next? Well for starters, I still need to design and implement the pixel art badges. As of now it's
                        just text, so not a full update which is why it's 2.5 and not 3.0. However once I get that done, I need to add some
                        more content to the store, meaning new confetti more colors, text color options etc. Which will include more JS changes.
                        But once all of that is said and done I have plans to work on the CSS to really clean up the look of the game.
                        After that the game will be done and we will see whether or not I have further plans to work on the game.</p>
                    
                        <br><strong>September 28th 2021</strong><br>
                        <p>V2.7 is a relatively small and simple update, but much needed. The achievements tab feels more game like as you can see what achievements
                        have been earned and are still locked as opposed to having a blank page. Also went through and fixed some functions where
                        achievements were impossible to unlock. Also added a new image to clearly show which achievements have not been unlocked
                        So instead of just displaying once invisible achievements, the achievements are always shown but now only the images change.
                        With this new update the game feels much more alive and playful. So I feel comfortable now switching my time from doing programming
                        to a little bit of art. Don't worry I'm not giving up coding as I still have a mechanic I want to add for the achievements that would allow
                        players to use points to get hints for how to earn each achievement.</p>
                    
                        <br><strong>September 29th 2021</strong><br>
                        <p>V2.8 is another small update that adds just a little bit of flair to the game. It adds a hint button to each achievement
                        where players can use there points to unlock a descprition on how to earn the achievement. As of now though the hints
                        do not stay unlocked upon a refresh of the page, so I'll need to add another local storage item to keep track of that.
                        So for my next step I can focus on doing the art for the new badges along with a couple of CSS changes to clean up the look across the game.</p>

                        This project was originally created as a school project back in April 2020.
                        For a month I had to program a site that used Two APIs together to create something useful.
                        So I designed my own API using PHP to organize and return Landmarks based on user input.
                        then combined with the MapBox API, I was able to map out and give back the location of those
                        landmarks.
                        <br><br>
                        While I was unable to finish the project, the final product would've included functionality
                        such as facts and pictures of the landmarks showing up, more ways to filter through landmarks,
                        and more ways to interact with the map.
                        <br><br>
                        Overall the project deals in HTML/CSS, JSON, PHP, and APIs.

                        Outer Space Experience was a school projected I worked on in March of 2020.
                        The goal of the project was to create a visual experience using Canvas and the AudioContext API to
                        allow a user to change multiple settings of what was being shown. I gave users the options to change
                        the speed of the surrounding planets, the color and direction of the visual audio.
                        <br><br>
                        The project is finished as of right now with no urgency for updates. My plans for the project however
                        do include some updates to the layout and the audio waves because they aren't perfectly perpendicular.
                        Other than that it's just going through and refreshing myself on AudioContext, Canvas, and seeing other
                        ways to improve on the project.
