                As I'm writing this at approximately 1:13 AM one thing comes to mind,
                accomplishment. For the past two weeks or so I've been working on my
                portfolio website from scratch. While it would be as simple and easy
                to just find a template, post my resume on it and call it a day, I didn't
                want that. HTML and CSS are not my strong suits and I wanted to fix 
                that. Challenging myself is the goal for this portfolio and so far I 
                think I've done a great job. 
                <br><br>As of this moment, I've successfully created cards that link to
                past projects and worked on page responsiveness that changes the size
                and layout of necessary elements. While that may not sound impressing,
                taming the beast that is CSS, for me is an achievement.
                <br><br>What's the plan now? Now I'm going to keep working on the 
                portfolio. Clean up the CSS and make the overall appearance look more
                clean. I'm also going to work on my past projects and try to expand my
                skills with JavaScript.
