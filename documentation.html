            <p class="update">
                As I'm writing this at approximately 1:13 AM one thing comes to mind,
                accomplishment. For the past two weeks or so I've been working on my
                portfolio website from scratch. While it would be as simple and easy
                to just find a template, post my resume on it and call it a day, I didn't
                want that. HTML and CSS are not my strong suits and I wanted to fix 
                that. Challenging myself is the goal for this portfolio and so far I 
                think I've done a great job. 
                <br><br>As of this moment, I've successfully created cards that link to
                past projects and worked on page responsiveness that changes the size
                and layout of necessary elements. While that may not sound impressing,
                taming the beast that is CSS, for me is an achievement.
                <br><br>What's the plan now? Now I'm going to keep working on the 
                portfolio. Clean up the CSS and make the overall appearance look more
                clean. I'm also going to work on my past projects and try to expand my
                skills with JavaScript.
            </p>

                It has been awhle since the last update and for that I apologize. Do not
                fear my plans remain unchanged! At the moment I've been kepy busy with
                midterms, co-op searching, and personal stuff. Now that I found some free
                time to update my website I thought it was necessary for another update.
                <br><br>For this update, after some discussion and feedback with my advisor
                I've made some changes to the layout and added more stuff. Don't worry I'm 
                not done yet and plan on more things like documentation pages for my projects
                and adding more projects.
            </p>

            <h4 class="updateHead">-March 29th, 2021</h4>
            <p class="update">
                For the latest update I added some flair to the buttons; hovering colors, open a 
                new tab for projects, and responsiveness on smaller window screens. I am aware 
                though that the buttons do overlap on smaller phone screens and I plan to 
                update that at a later time.
                <br><br>I've also made some smaller updates with responsiveness and color 
                scheme. I can now say that I'm happy with the condition and look of my 
                portfolio. I'm in a position where any future projects or sections can be added
                comfortably and without much problems to provide easy responsiveness. Now I can
                switch my focus to updating old projects as well as include other things like 
                documentation pages for each of them.
                <br><br>It goes without saying that this portfolio is nowhere perfect and there
                is plenty room for improvement, but I want to get back into coding projects other
                than html/css and I'm excited to show off what I can create.

                It has been quite a while since my last update. For good reason. I took focus
                towards my academics hoping to finish strong this semester and have achieved just that.
                I write this during the last week of school and have finally finished everything. Now I
                will be shifting my focus on getting a co-op. So for this upcoming summer I have many 
                plans to get myself in a better position when I start to apply.
                <br><br>
                The plans are such:<br>
                - Update and polish my Portfolio<br>
                - Work on new side projects<br>
                - Revamp and update old projects
                <br><br>
                As of this new update I'm currently working on restructuring the layout and look of my
                homepage. With this new update a different presentation of my projiects. Before it was 
                a grouped up showing of each project, but now it's more like a slideshow. In my opinion
                it makes the presentation stand out more and not look so clunky. I just need to make it
                look appealing, but that will be done slowly after this update is out. Hopefully by 
                the time anyone reads it, this will be done.
